# Wearable_assignment
The code in the file "run.analysis.R" in this repository performs some merging, sorting and calculation tasks on accelerometer data from wearable technology.  
Specifically:  
1) Merges a "training" and "test" set to create one data set  
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,  
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,  
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names,  
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
